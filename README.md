## Easily insert any Snippet's code anywhere in your Page

Easysnippet displays the full list of all your Snippets in **a menu**, so that you can  
use them quickly while editing a Page.

When a menu option is selected or a button is clicked, the corresponding Snippet  
**code is inserted** into your Page at the cursor.

An option to **display buttons** instead (for when you don't have that many snippets)  
can be enabled in the Settings panel.


## Download

For WolfCMS v0.8.3 or above use GitHub's [Download ZIP](https://github.com/svanlaere/easysnippet/archive/master.zip) button.

Last version compatible with lower versions of WolfCMS is at [7354993f](https://github.com/svanlaere/easysnippet/archive/7354993ff75ea5580446f7550380bcb77f3a956d.zip).

## Installation

Just remove *-master* from the folder name, if you used GitHub's button to download a ZIP.  
Put the resulting folder in your `wolf/plugins/` folder, so that the file `index.php`  
is in `wolf/plugins/easysnippet/index.php` and enable the plugin in Administration tab.
